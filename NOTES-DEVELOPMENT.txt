Entity Component System
---
UPDATE 2/15: After reading more about entity component system, I realize I'm not
doing it very extensible..works fine for now, but will be too complex later.
Good analogy is a key - entity is key, teeth are components. Systems are locks
that components fit into. (http://gamedev.stackexchange.com/questions/31473/role-of-systems-in-entity-systems-architecture/31491#31491)



To keep in mind:
    -Uses events for communication between Entities and Entity
        -when entity updates a component, event is triggered

-Questions:
    -Should coupled components have dependencies?
        -e.g., Physics requires entity to have a Position component.
            when adding a physics component, should it error or require a
            position component to exist already (or add one automaticaly?)
        -How to manage component <-> component dependencies?

    -Let's say I want to do something like grouping components by a type. 
    For instance, I have a Human and Zombie component which I consider to be
    'creatures', but I want my system to be a bit simplier and be able to 
    access any type of creature without modifying the system code everytime
    I add a new creature component.
        I could have a system for each Human and Zombie component, OR could
        I have a system for 'creatures' which Human and Zombie components
        will tap into
    Human and Zombie components assume the entity has a 'creature' component
    (or, is it ok to make these components add the creature component if it 
    doesn't have one already?).  They modify behavior but expose the same 
    interface - in other words, both components do all their checking for
    health / isDead state in the tick() function, which they extend the
    creature component tick().
    
    The system calls the tick() function for the creature component, which 
    in turn is really accessing the zombie or human component's tick function


    Problem - if an entity is a zombie AND a human

TODO
=========================================
Place world wrapping functionality in world component instead of physics?
