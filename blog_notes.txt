OTHER PROBLEMS IT SOLVES:
    -simplifies game loop



Entity - Component - System (ECS) is another programming concept, like Object
Oriented Programming or Functional Programming.  It's fundementally different
though, just how funcitonal programming is fundementally different than Object
Oriented Programming.  ECS is a form of data driven programming - where the emphasis
is placed on data, as opposed to in OOP where the emphasis is placed on Objects.

Managing complexity is the root of most programming challenges. Programming 
patterns exist to help you manage complexity.

The problems of developing games are a bit different than the problems of 
developing other types of application, so it makes sense that there might exist 
a better tool than the ones used for other types of development work. 

With OOP, data encapsulation is a big concept - you usually don't want to share
data between objects.  All the inner workings of objects are hidden from you.
You usually don't want an object's data to change outside of that object itself
changing it (through some interface or method call).

ECS sort of flips this idea around.  ECS is a form of Data Driven Programming.
With ECS, data is freely exposed and can be mutated.  OOP and ECS are inheriently
incompatible - they're two different metaphors for how you structure your program.
There is a lot of value in having your game code be data driven - from adding and modifying
behaviors at runtime, changing data after your code is compiled, etc.
Chances are if you know about ECS you know the benfits, but if you're trying to wrap
your head around ECS like I am, understanding the concept might help.

ECS is built on three concepts - Entities, Components, and Systems.

ENTITES
An entity represents something in your game world.  However, they don't have
data.  They are basically just an ID and a collection of Components.  You don't
actually "do" anything to an entity.  There's no "entity.swingSword()" method,
because entities themselves are just a collection of components.

COMPONENTS
A component is data.  

Let's say we want to define a "human" entity.  It
would be built from numerous components (this is where "object composition" comes
into play). So, the entity would have components like:
    -health
    -age
    -position
    -renderable

Each component just contains data.  The position component might contain an x
and y value.  The renderable component might just contain a BOOLEAN with a value
of TRUE.

One key concept here is that components don't know about other components, and
components don't contain logic.  You might have some getter or setter functions
to help access the data, but ideally a component is nothing but data.

SYSTEMS
Systems perform logic based on components.  They're the 'drivers' of the
data-driven concept (and the data is the cars? maybe this analogy isn't so
obvious).
A system will do stuff to entities that have some component. And when I mean
"do stuff to entities", I actually mean "do stuff to the components an entity
contains".  An entity itself doesn't have any data, the data lives in the components.


-can change components at runtime, which means behaviors can change.


=========================================
Struggles / learning processes

-Initially I put a modest amount of logic in the controllers to help get / set
properties, but it became more obvious over time that while it worked, it didn't
work well. 
This programming concept sounded powerful, but it didn't truly sink in
until I started implementing it.  I had a few similar experiences when I started
working with D3js (a data driven data visualization library, similar concepts to
ECS) - really experiencing how powerful letting the data drive functionality can
be.  With ECS, I really started to grasp it when one of my systems created a new
entity based off components of parent entities. One of those components was a user
input component and ended up controlling a bunch of entities.
The effect itself is nothing spectacular - it's no big issue to write some
OOP solution using a factory pattern that would create new entities...the beauty
here is that I didn't have to code anything extra to get this behavior.  I didn't
have to write a bunch of code to handle what happens if I have multiple objects
that can be user controlled - but it was unexpected.
I got it for free, and it just worked! (Of course, making it work well from a 
gameplay standpoint is another issue).  





World - initially behavior for getting cell position was in a component, but it
makes more sense to put it in a system
